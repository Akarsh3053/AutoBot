        <h1 >Say Hi to the AutoBot</h1>
        <p>It is a web-based AutoML application. This application is designed to train Machine 
        Learning models on a provided dataset. The images you see represent various aspects of the project. The crystal ball 
        image symbolizes the predictive power of machine learning models, which can "see" patterns in data and make 
        predictions about future data. The high-tech theme of the images reflects the advanced algorithms and computational 
        processes involved in training these models. The web-based nature of the application means that it can be accessed 
        from anywhere with an internet connection, making it highly accessible and user-friendly. Users can upload their 
        datasets, select the type of model they want to train, and then let the application handle the rest. The application 
        will automatically preprocess the data, select the best model parameters, and train the model. Once the model is 
        trained, users can download it for use in their own projects or use it directly within the application to make 
        predictions on new data. Overall, AutoBot represents a powerful tool for anyone looking to 
        leverage the power of machine learning, whether they are experienced data scientists or beginners just starting out 
        in the field.</p>

            <p>Once your dataset is uploaded, explore its characteristics through the "Profiling" section.
            Crystal Ball performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to provide insights into the dataset's structure, statistics, and patterns.</p>
            <h3>Train Your Model</h3>
            <p>Move on to the "Modelling" section to initiate the model training process. 
            Choose the target column for your classification or regression task.
            Crystal Ball automates the setup, compares different models, and selects the best-performing one.</p>
            <h3>Download Your Model:</h3>
            <p>After the model is trained, download it for use in your projects. Utilize the "Download" section to obtain the trained model file.</p>
